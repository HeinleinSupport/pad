This branch contains the piratepad.net styling and configuration of
Etherpad.

This branch contains no generic new functionality, it is basicly just
tracking my master branch, with some added styling patches.

This branch should be running on beta.piratepad.net at any time, and
is used to create release branches for piratepad.net
